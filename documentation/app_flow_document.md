# App Flow Document for ai-code

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

At this earliest stage, there is no dedicated onboarding screen or sign-in process. A new user discovers the project by visiting the GitHub repository for `ai-code`. The only entry point is the `README.md` file displayed on the project’s main page. There is no account creation, password recovery, or social login since no authentication system exists yet.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Since there is currently no graphical or web interface, there is no dashboard or home page beyond the repository view on GitHub. The repository’s root presents the `README.md` content, which serves as the sole landing “page.” Users navigate purely by scrolling through that markdown file.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

At present, the project has no interactive features, modules, or workflows implemented. There is no file upload, no profile editing section, no settings panel, and no payment or admin pages. As a result, there are no transitions between pages or feature paths to follow. The entire experience today consists of viewing and editing the `README.md` in the GitHub interface or within a local clone of the repository.

## Settings and Account Management

No settings page or account management features are present. Users cannot update personal information, configure notifications, or manage billing. There are no forms or preference screens. Interaction with the project is limited to Git operations (clone, pull, push) and markdown editing.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Because there is no application UI or backend, there are no runtime error screens or validation messages. Users who encounter connectivity issues with GitHub will see standard Git or GitHub error messages, such as authentication failures when pushing without proper credentials, but these are not part of any custom application design.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

In its current form, the `ai-code` project has no user-facing application flow. The only journey a visitor takes is to open the repository, read or update the placeholder `README.md`, and then close the browser or exit their code editor. All future flows—such as sign-in, feature navigation, settings, and error handling—are yet to be defined and will be introduced as the AI code and accompanying UI are developed.

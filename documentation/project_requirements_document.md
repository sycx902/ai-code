# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

**ai-code** is a starter kit for machine learning and artificial intelligence projects. Right now, it’s just an empty folder with a placeholder README. The goal is to turn it into a well-organized, reusable skeleton that saves data scientists and AI engineers from reinventing the wheel every time they start a new experiment.

By the end of version 1, **ai-code** will provide a clear folder layout, basic scripts for training and evaluation, a simple example model, and tooling for configuration, testing, and documentation. Success means that any new AI project can begin by cloning this repo, running one setup command, and immediately having a working pipeline with minimal boilerplate.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope (Version 1)
- Directory structure: `src/`, `models/`, `data/`, `notebooks/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `config/`.
- A basic example model (e.g., simple feed-forward neural network in PyTorch).
- Training script (`train.py`) that reads a config file, runs one epoch, and prints a metric.
- Evaluation script (`evaluate.py`) that loads the trained model and prints test results.
- Command-line interface (CLI) tool for common tasks (`init`, `train`, `eval`).
- Configuration management using a library (e.g., Hydra) with sample YAML files.
- Unit tests covering core modules with pytest.
- Code formatting and linting setup (`black`, `flake8`, pre-commit hooks).
- Continuous integration (CI) pipeline using GitHub Actions to run tests and linters on every push.
- Documentation template in Sphinx (basic installation and usage guide).
- License file (MIT) and contribution guidelines stub.

### Out-of-Scope (Later Phases)
- Domain-specific data loaders (e.g., for images or text beyond the example dataset).
- Production deployment scripts or Docker images.
- Distributed training support or GPU cluster orchestration.
- Experiment tracking integrations (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases).
- Advanced model architectures or hyperparameter tuning frameworks.

## 3. User Flow

1. A developer clones the `ai-code` repository from GitHub. They run `poetry install` (or `pip install -r requirements.txt`) to set up dependencies.
2. They type `python cli.py init` to scaffold any missing folders and generate a default `config/default.yaml`.
3. Next, they call `python cli.py train --config config/default.yaml`. The training script loads data from `data/`, builds the example model in `src/models.py`, trains for one epoch, and outputs a loss metric.
4. When they’re ready to check results, they run `python cli.py evaluate --config config/default.yaml`. The tool loads the saved model from `models/`, evaluates it on a test split, and prints accuracy.
5. Throughout development, they write new modules in `src/`, add tests in `tests/`, and update docs in `docs/`. Every push to the repo triggers GitHub Actions to run pytest and linters, giving immediate feedback.

## 4. Core Features
- **Project Scaffolding (CLI)**: A small command-line interface for initializing the project structure.
- **Directory Layout**: Predefined folders for source code, data, models, tests, docs, and config.
- **Example Model**: A minimal neural network implemented in PyTorch, showing how to structure `src/models.py`.
- **Training Script**: `train.py` that reads a YAML config file and runs a training loop.
- **Evaluation Script**: `evaluate.py` that loads the model and reports metrics.
- **Configuration Management**: Use Hydra (or similar) to handle hyperparameters and file paths via `config/*.yaml` files.
- **Testing Suite**: Pytest tests for data loading, model instantiation, and script outputs.
- **Code Quality Tools**: Black for code formatting, Flake8 for linting, and pre-commit hooks to enforce standards.
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow to run tests and linters on each pull request.
- **Basic Documentation**: Sphinx setup with instructions on setup, training, evaluation, and contribution.
- **License & Contributing**: MIT LICENSE and a CONTRIBUTING.md outlining how to add features and fix bugs.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools
- **Language**: Python 3.9+ (widely supported in AI community).
- **Frameworks & Libraries**:
  - PyTorch (model definition & training).
  - Hydra (configuration management).
  - Pytest (testing).
  - Sphinx (documentation generation).
- **Development Tools**:
  - Poetry or pip + virtualenv (dependency management).
  - Black & Flake8 (code formatting & linting).
  - pre-commit (automated checks on `git commit`).
  - GitHub Actions (CI/CD pipeline).
- **IDE Plugins (optional)**:
  - Visual Studio Code with Python extension.
  - Cursor or Windsurf for AI-powered code completion.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The example training run should complete in under 60 seconds on a standard laptop CPU.
- **Reliability**: CI pipeline must pass 100% of tests and linters on every push.
- **Usability**: Running `cli.py --help` shows clear usage instructions for each command.
- **Maintainability**: Code coverage should stay above 80% for core modules.
- **Security**: Dependencies must come only from PyPI, pinned to specific versions to avoid supply-chain issues.
- **Compliance**: The project is released under the MIT license, documented in `LICENSE`.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions
- **Python Environment**: Users have Python 3.9+ installed and can create virtual environments.
- **Hardware**: No GPU is required for the example—CPU training only.
- **Third-Party Services**: No external APIs or cloud services are integrated in v1.
- **Config Library**: Hydra (or chosen equivalent) must support reading YAML files without additional setup.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Mixing Black, Flake8, and certain PyTorch versions can cause version mismatches. Pin versions tightly in `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`.
- **Cross-Platform Paths**: File paths in configs must work on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Use `pathlib` in Python code.
- **Slow CI on Large Tests**: If tests grow too big, CI time may exceed reasonable limits. Keep example data tiny or mock data loaders where possible.
- **User Error in Config**: Misformatted YAML can crash scripts. Add validation and clear error messages via schema checks.

With this PRD, the **ai-code** repository has a clear, unambiguous foundation. Subsequent documents—such as detailed tech-stack specs, frontend/backend guidelines (if a UI is added later), or deployment instructions—can now be created without guessing the basics of project layout, tooling, or objectives.

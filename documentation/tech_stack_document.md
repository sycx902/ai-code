# Tech Stack Document for ai-code

This document explains, in everyday language, the technology choices for the **ai-code** project. Even though the repository is just getting started, we outline the tools and services we plan to use, why we picked them, and how they fit together.

## 1. Frontend Technologies

At this initial stage, **ai-code** does not include a traditional web or mobile interface. Instead, developers work with scripts and interactive notebooks. If and when we build a user-facing interface, we plan to use:

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: A familiar environment for data exploration and model prototyping.  
- **Streamlit** (future): A simple way to turn Python scripts into shareable web apps without deep front-end coding.  
- **React** (optional): If the project needs a richer web UI, React can power dynamic dashboards and user interactions.

These tools let us focus first on AI model development and experiment tracking before investing in a full-blown frontend.

## 2. Backend Technologies

The core of **ai-code** is about building and running AI models. For this, we rely on:

- **Python**: The de facto language for AI and machine learning, with a vast ecosystem of libraries.  
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Handle numerical computations and data manipulation in a clear, efficient way.  
- **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow**: Leading AI frameworks for building and training deep learning models.  
- **scikit-learn**: A go-to library for classical machine learning algorithms and utilities.  

Directory structure (planned):

- `src/` – Core code and model definitions  
- `models/` – Saved model files and architecture code  
- `data/` – Raw and processed datasets or data loaders  
- `notebooks/` – Exploratory analysis and prototype models  
- `tests/` – Automated tests to ensure code quality  
- `docs/` – Extended documentation beyond the README  
- `config/` – Configuration files (e.g., YAML or JSON settings)

This setup keeps our code organized, easy to navigate, and simple to extend.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment

To make development smooth, reliable, and scalable, we plan to use:

- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub as the central code repository.  
  • Branch strategy:  
    – `main` for production-ready code  
    – `develop` for ongoing work  
    – feature branches for individual tasks  
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions to automatically run tests, lint code, and build Docker images on each commit.  
- **Containerization**: Docker to package our code and its environment so it runs the same anywhere.  
- **Cloud Hosting** (future): AWS or GCP for training large models and serving results.  
  • Possible services: EC2 or GKE for compute, S3 or Cloud Storage for data, and ECR/GCR for Docker images.  
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow (or Weights & Biases) to log metrics, parameters, and model versions in one place.

These tools help us catch errors early, deploy consistently, and scale up as model size or user load grows.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations

As the project matures, we’ll connect to services that save time and add functionality:

- **MLflow / Weights & Biases**: Tracks experiments, compares runs, and stores artifacts.  
- **Cloud Storage (AWS S3 / GCP Storage)**: Keeps large datasets and model outputs reliably in the cloud.  
- **Slack / Email Notifications**: Alerts the team when long-running jobs finish or fail.  
- **Docker Hub or Private Container Registry**: Hosts our built images for easy deployment.

By leveraging these services, we avoid reinventing the wheel and keep our focus on core AI work.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations

Even in early stages, we take security and performance seriously:

- **Secure Development**:  
  • Use virtual environments (e.g., `venv` or Conda) to isolate dependencies.  
  • Pin library versions in `requirements.txt` to avoid unexpected changes.  
  • Store secrets (API keys, database passwords) outside code, using environment variables or a secret manager.  
- **Access Control**:  
  • Grant cloud and repository access on a need-to-know basis.  
  • Protect the `main` branch to prevent unauthorized changes.  
- **Data Protection**:  
  • Encrypt sensitive data at rest (in cloud storage) and in transit (using HTTPS).  
- **Performance Optimization**:  
  • Leverage GPU instances for model training to speed up computations.  
  • Use vectorized operations (NumPy/Pandas) to process data efficiently.  
  • Cache intermediate results when possible to reduce repeated work.

These measures ensure our code is reliable, safe, and runs smoothly as data and usage grow.

## 6. Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

Our technology choices for **ai-code** are guided by three main goals: **clarity**, **scalability**, and **developer productivity**. By starting with:

- **Python** and its AI libraries (PyTorch/TensorFlow, scikit-learn) we tap into a rich ecosystem.  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (and potentially Streamlit/React later) we keep the development process interactive and approachable.  
- **GitHub**, **Docker**, and **GitHub Actions** we ensure consistent, automated builds and tests.  
- **Cloud services** and **experiment trackers** we prepare for growth and collaboration.  
- **Security best practices** we safeguard our data and infrastructure from the start.

This stack gives us a solid foundation for building, testing, and deploying AI models in a controlled, transparent way. As the project evolves, we can plug in additional tools—like advanced monitoring or a richer frontend—without disrupting our core workflows.

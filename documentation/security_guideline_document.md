# AI-Code Repository Security Guidelines

This document provides comprehensive security guidance tailored to the `ai-code` repository. It establishes foundational principles, best practices, and actionable controls to ensure a secure development lifecycle as the project evolves.

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

- **Objective:** Define security controls and processes for the `ai-code` project from initialization through production.
- **Audience:** Developers, DevOps engineers, project managers, and security reviewers.
- **Coverage:** Repository structure, development workflow, coding practices, dependency management, CI/CD, deployment, and maintenance.

---

## 2. Core Security Principles

1. **Security by Design**  
   Embed security decisions from day one; evaluate threats at each design milestone.
2. **Least Privilege**  
   Grant only the minimum permissions required for each component or user.
3. **Defense in Depth**  
   Layer multiple controls (network, application, data) so a breach in one layer doesn’t compromise the system.
4. **Input Validation & Output Encoding**  
   Treat all input as untrusted; validate rigorously and encode outputs to prevent injections.
5. **Fail Securely**  
   Ensure errors do not leak sensitive data; default to a safe state.
6. **Keep Security Simple**  
   Prefer clear, maintainable controls over complex mechanisms.
7. **Secure Defaults**  
   Configure features to the most secure settings by default, requiring explicit enablement to reduce misconfiguration risks.

## 3. Secure Project Initialization

### 3.1 Repository Structure & Documentation

- Establish a secure directory layout early:  
  • `src/` – Core code  
  • `models/` – ML model definitions & artifacts  
  • `data/` – Raw/processed datasets and ingestion scripts  
  • `notebooks/` – Prototyping and analysis  
  • `tests/` – Automated unit and integration tests  
  • `config/` – Configuration files (use a separate secure vault for secrets)  
  • `docs/` – Extended documentation  
- Harden the `README.md`: articulate security requirements, coding standards, and setup instructions.
- Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `SECURITY.md` to guide secure contributions and vulnerability reporting.
- Include a `LICENSE` file to define usage and distribution rights.

### 3.2 Development Environment

- Use containerization (e.g., Docker) or virtual environments to isolate dependencies.
- Enforce linters and formatters (e.g., `flake8`, `black`) in pre-commit hooks.
- Store secrets (API keys, tokens) in a secrets manager (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) rather than `.env` files or code.
- Enable IDE/editor security plugins for static analysis where available.

---

## 4. Secure Coding Practices

### 4.1 Input Handling & Validation

- Never trust user or external inputs.  
- Apply strong validation on all API inputs (type, length, range, format).  
- Use parameterized queries or ORM methods to prevent SQL/NoSQL injection.

### 4.2 Output Encoding & XSS Prevention

- Contextually escape or sanitize data before rendering in web views.  
- Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict script sources.

### 4.3 CSRF and Session Security

- For any future web interface or API:  
  • Implement anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing requests.  
  • Secure cookies with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Strict` attributes.  
  • Enforce session timeouts (idle and absolute) and provide logout endpoints.

### 4.4 Authentication & Authorization

- Adopt role-based access control (RBAC) for project resources.  
- Use proven libraries (e.g., OAuth 2.0 frameworks) for token-based auth, ensuring strict signature and expiration checks.  
- Plan for multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative or privileged actions.

---

## 5. Dependency Management

- Maintain a lockfile (`requirements.txt` with hashes, `Pipfile.lock`) for deterministic builds.
- Scan dependencies continuously using SCA tools (e.g., GitHub Dependabot, Snyk) to detect known vulnerabilities.
- Limit the dependency footprint; remove unused libraries promptly.
- Replace unmaintained or insecure packages proactively.

---

## 6. Data Protection & Privacy

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest using AES-256 or equivalent.  
- Enforce TLS 1.2+ for all data in transit; redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
- Implement data masking or tokenization for PII in logs and interfaces.
- Avoid logging sensitive fields (passwords, personal identifiers).

---

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline Security

- Integrate static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic analysis (DAST) into CI workflows.
- Enforce branch protections on `main` and `develop`; require code reviews and successful CI checks before merges.
- Store CI/CD secrets in encrypted environment variables or vault integrations.
- Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities before deployment.

---

## 8. Infrastructure & Deployment

- Harden host OS and containers by disabling unnecessary services and using minimal base images.
- Expose only essential network ports; leverage host-based firewalls and security groups.
- Implement automated patch management for operating systems and dependencies.
- Enforce secure TLS configurations (strong ciphers, disable SSLv3/TLS1.0/1.1).
- Deploy runtime security agents (e.g., container scanners, host intrusion detection).

---

## 9. Monitoring, Logging & Incident Response

- Centralize logs (application, audit, access) in a secure SIEM solution.
- Monitor for anomalous behavior (failed logins, privilege changes, abnormal traffic).
- Define an incident response plan with roles, communication channels, and post-mortem processes.

---

## 10. Ongoing Maintenance & Review

- Schedule periodic security reviews and dependency audits.
- Update documentation (`SECURITY.md`, `README.md`) as practices evolve.
- Conduct quarterly threat modeling sessions to reassess risks as features are added.

By adhering to these guidelines, the `ai-code` project will establish a robust security posture from inception, reducing risks and building trust with stakeholders. Regularly revisiting and refining these controls ensures ongoing resilience against emerging threats.
